## Background and Summary
Global warming is predicted to be more amplified in the Arctic compared to other regions of the world (IPCC, 2013). The current pace of climate change in the Arctic necessitates proper assessments of plant community responses to a warmer climate. 

#Climate warming has wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity and functioning of alpine ecosystems, affecting phenology1,2, species ranges3,4, local plant abundance and biodiversity5,6, and ecosystem carbon, nutrient, and water fluxes7. However, there is also substantial variation between systems and regions in magnitude and directions of the response to a given climate change8–10. These context-dependencies limit our understanding of observed climate change impacts and our ability to forecast future trends in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning11,12. Comparisons across sites or regions, either through formalized replicated experiments or meta-analyses and other types of syntheses, are critically important to understand what drives the variation in biodiversity and ecosystem response to climate change. 

#Trait-based approaches offer opportunities for generalization and improved process-based understanding in global change ecology; and in particular for understanding drivers and consequences of context-dependencies in climate responses. Functional traits underlie variation among individuals in their ability to survive, reproduce, and function under different environmental conditions13–15. Because traits vary both within and between species, and can be affected by environment, evolutionary history and plasticity16,17, trait-based approaches offer great opportunity for improved understanding of the drivers, constraints and consequences of variability in biodiversity and ecosystem responses to climate change. In alpine regions, where temperature is a major limiting factor, traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum, a set of leaf traits that characterize individuals along a continuum from ‘fast’ to ‘slow’ photosynthetic and tissue turnover rates and life histories18–20, should be particularly relevant for responses to climatic warming. Functional traits thus improve our mechanistic understanding of species’ response to and functioning under climate change by providing a linkage between the phenotypes of individuals and the environment. An advantage of a trait-based approach is that trait measures offer a ‘common currency’ that facilitates comparison across regions and systems that may not share many taxa, as well as across experimental approaches. 

#Impacts of climate warming on plant communities are studied through four main empirical approaches. First, climate effects are assessed along natural elevation gradients, assuming a space-for-time substitution21,22. Second, ongoing climate change is studied through resampling of natural communities over time6,23. A third approach relies on on-site experimental warming, for example by Open Top Chambers (OTCs)8,24. A fourth approach is to transplant whole communities to warmer and/or cooler climates25–27. Each method has strengths and weaknesses, for example, gradient and resampling studies allow large-scale and long-term comparisons, OTCs experimentally expose intact extant communities to new climates, whereas community transplants manipulate both the biotic and the abiotic environment thus exploring the net effect of both direct and indirect climate change impacts28,29. Combining different approaches within a single study or system can be a powerful way to exploit these complementary strengths. 

Seabirds are important providers of nutrients to terrestrial vegetation, especially in the High Arctic. Guano deposition provides ocean-derived nutrients to ecosystems, but this effect is not homogeneous. Many seabirds nest in cliffs along oceans, creating a gradient of nutrients leading away from the colony; however, the specific influence of seabird nutrient deposition is still debated. Research conflicts regarding seabird influence on vegetation. More research is needed to clarify seabird influence in Arctic ecosystems.

In this paper, we report data on biodiversity and ecosystem function from one warming experiment and two elevational gradients in Adventdalen, Longyearbyen Svalbard. For the warming experiment, we used on of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) sites with passive Open Top Chambers (OTC) warming plots (+ 1-2 °C relative to control plots) in three different habitats located in Endalen. The ITEX site in Endalen has been running since 2002 and  is one of few High Arctic sites included in the ITEX network and syntheses. Additionally, we To study the effect of seabirds on plant communities, we compared the responses along the elevation gradient with a parallel birdcliff nutrient affected elevational gradient.

#Across four study sites we conducted an elevation gradient study, in situ warming experiments using OTCs, and reciprocal community transplantation experiments (warming and cooling) between all pairs of neighbouring sites and, as an extreme treatment, between the highest and lowest sites (extreme warming and cooling). In all three approaches, plant species richness, cover and associated climate data were measured each year from 2012 to 201629. Plant functional traits of the vascular plant community were collected from the local grassland flora of each site in 2015 and 2016, and from the experimental treatments in 2016. The resulting datasets encompass vegetation and climate data and 36,743 trait measurements from 193 taxa, which extends existing trait data from the regional flora by ca. 100 additional species, and increases the number of unique trait measurements from this regional flora by 500%, according to the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN; http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/) database32. These traits campaigns were conducted as part of two Plant Functional Traits Courses (PFTC1 and PFTC2) for international students in trait-based theory and methods (see also30,31). The data are comparable with data from later courses in Wayquecha, Peru (PFTC3 and 5) in 2018 and 2020 and Longyearbyen, Svalbard (PFTC4) in 2018 as well as with upcoming courses.




We therefore focussed on temperature and warming as drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and studied plant functional trait, biodiversity, ecophysiology, and ecosystem responses in a warming experiment part of the  (ITEX), and along an elevational gradient near Longyearbyen. 




The PFTC4 thus used two main study systems; we studied two elevational gradients, one of which was affected by nutrient runoff from a birdcliff, and we studied the ITEX Open Top Chamber experimental warming site at Endalen. In addition, we conducted smaller additional studies (additional drone imagery and Saxifraga polyploidy study) which are described below. 

The PFTC4 consisted of five main student group projects (1, 2, 4, 5, 7), and two smaller projects (3,6) which were conducted during the ‘other traits’ day: 

Traits along elevation and nutrient gradient project. This project aimed to assess the role of climate and biotic factors in determining plant community leaf trait composition. sites used were the elevational gradients with and without birdcliff influence. In addition to the ‘standard’  PFTC course investigation of traits along an altitudinal gradient, we thus also studies the effect of seabirds along this gradient (see section 2.1 for site descriptions and sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 for response variables).
Warming/ITEX-experiment project. the aim of this group project was to use a trait-based approach to assess how local plant communities and populations respond to experimental climate and grazing treatments.  We examined the impacts of long-term experimental warming on different plant functional traits in this high Arctic environment, both on individual and community level, with the aim to study plant functional trait responses to climate warming, which will increase understanding of potential feedback mechanisms (see section 2.2 for site descriptions and sections 3.1 and 3.2 for response variables)
Bryophyte traits project- smaller ‘other traits day’ project. Bryophytes are important components of the arctic tundra vegetation and ecosystem functioning,  and the high arctic ecosystems of Svalbard in particular. Our gradients/sites are rich in bryophytes, in some vegetation is dominated by bryophytes. Bryophytes differ fundamentally from vascular plants: poikilohydry, no true roots, etc. This makes different traits relevant than in vascular plants, and different trait methodology is needed.  This was explored during the ‘other traits day (see section 2.1 for site descriptions and sections 3.3 for response variables).
Leaf Photosynthesis Temperature Response project. The aim of our project was to capture how photosynthetic capacity and leaf thermoregulation of arctic plant species varied with leaf temperature (see section 2.1 for site descriptions and sections 3.5 for response variables).
CO2 Efflux project. The main objective of this study was to measure how functional trait composition influences ecosystem functioning by measuring CO2-flux within and across plant communities. The project  measure CO2 fluxes in arctic plant communities along the elevation gradient and within the ITEX warming experiment. We also examine the relationship between elevation and carbon fluxes and ecosystem productivity across the elevation gradient plots in Bjørndalen (birdclif elevational gradient) and Lindholmhøgda (control elevational gradient) (see section 2.2 for site descriptions and sections 3.6 for response variables).
Saxifraga oppositifolia project - smaller ‘other traits day’ project. Saxifraga oppositifolia is an Arctic-alpine species, which shows interesting variation in morphology and ecology along a wide range of habitats and season length. Pernille Bronken Eidesen from UNIS has, along the habitats in the valley of Adventdalen, an established study investigating the role of ploidy level of S. oppositifolia in the emergence of growth form and reproductive characteristics. We chose her sites in Endalen Valley for a pilot project examining the relationship between ploidy and functional traits and there visited her plants with known ploidy level (see section 2.3 for site descriptions and sections 3.7 for response variables).
Remote sensing and spectral reflectance project. The remote sensing component assessed canopy traits through reflectance spectra: from leaf to landscape-scale using drone technologies had three main aims: 1) To develop high resolution and precisely geopositioned maps (surface topography and vegetation, using a multispectral camera with 5 spectral bands: red, green, blue, NIR & red-edge) of the main study sites (plus additional sites of interest) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones); 2) To provide precise geolocations of the PFTC4 plots (to approximately 1 cm precision) using differential GPS measurements; 3) To compile a library of hyperspectral reflectance signatures of key vegetation types across the main sites in order to explore the relationships between plant traits and hyperspectral reflectance. It used the ITEX site, both gradients, and additional sites (see section 2 for site descriptions and sections 3.8 for response variables).



## Methods

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was initiated in the early 1990s to address impacts of climate warming on tundra plant phenology growth and reproduction across the Arctic and alpine tundra by setting a simple warming experiment and using standardised protocols. Later the emphasis moved to plant community responses to warming resulting in several syntheses.
